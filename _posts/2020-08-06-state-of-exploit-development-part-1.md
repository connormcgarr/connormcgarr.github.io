As you may or may not know, I work at [CrowdStrike](https://crowdstrike.com) for my day job. I am also apart of the red team and do not do any official exploit development/vulnerability research. I wanted to address why binary exploits often aren't as used anymore in typical red team toolkits and explain although the impact of a binary exploit, especially in the kernel, is far more effective than typical red team TTPs - is the return on investment worth it? I would love to see, personally, some red team research shift towards kernel exploits for local privilege escalation - which is often one of the more difficult parts of a penetration tests. But is binary exploitation even worth it at this point for red team work? Let's find out!

Enjoy! [Part 1](https://crowdstrike.com/blog/state-of-exploit-development-part-1)
