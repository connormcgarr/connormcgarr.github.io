Today I am very happy to have released my second blog for [CrowdStrike](https://crowdstrike.com)! This blog, which builds off of my [last one](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/state-of-exploit-development-part-1/), talks about some additional mitigations like ACG, XFG, and VBS/HVCI which have made exploitation more expensive and time consuming. This blog rounds out the series and I hope you have found it useful! I learned a lot when I put this two part series together.

You can find the blog [here](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/state-of-exploit-development-part-2/). Enjoy!
